Project Description: Pomodoro Timer with Pygame GUI

Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer with Pygame GUI project! This Python-based project offers a simple yet effective Pomodoro timer utilizing the pygame library for a graphical user interface.

How It Works:

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This timer follows that principle, allowing users to focus on tasks with structured breaks for improved productivity.

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python installed.
Run the main Python script.
If you don't have Python installed, you can run the .exe with the file "alarme.mp3" in the same folder.

Features:

Customizable timer intervals for both work and break sessions.
Visual cues and notifications to signify the start and end of each session.
Pause and resume functionality for flexibility during work sessions.

Why Pomodoro Timer with Pygame GUI? While there are numerous Pomodoro timer applications available, this project offers a lightweight and customizable solution in Python, making it accessible for developers to modify and extend according to their preferences.
The integration of a pygame graphical interface adds a visually appealing element to the timer, enhancing user experience and engagement during work sessions.
